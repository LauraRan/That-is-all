‘what' and 'if'
are two words as non-threatening as words can be
but put them together, side by side
and they have the power to haunt you for the rest of your life
　　
　　what if?
　　what if?
　　what if?
　　
I don't know how the story ended
but if what I felt then was true
then it's never too sad
if it was true then, it would be true for ever

I haven’t the courage to follow my heart. I dont know why people left the ones after crossing mountains and oceans
but I'd like to believe
if I ever were to feel it
that I'd have the courage to seize it

And, if I didn't
I hope one day that I will
